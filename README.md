## About

This program is part of my AI coursework at University, to create a minimax algorithm to win in a connect 4 game against another player. 
  - Note that I am still working on this to develop an interface for users to interact with!

Some features of the Minimax algorithm implemented here includes:
  - Depth parameter, a greater depth would allow the Minimax algorithm to "see better into the future" to predict and anticipate moves that the other player might make
  - Alpha/Beta Pruning to speed up response time and allow for greater depth to be used without compromising response time of the algorithm
  - Specific move ordering to optimise Alpha/Beta pruning
  - Heuristics to be able to identify winning/losing moves, as well as moves that could lead the algorithm one step closer to winning
